## ðŸŒ€ CLI Vibe Code
It helps you **write code**, **interact with your project**, and **run terminal commands** â€” all through natural language and intelligent suggestions.

---

> Currently I thought of 3 main approaches:

### 1. Vibe CLI Agent

Interact with your codebase using a conversational agent.

```bash
$ vibe .
ðŸŒˆ Vibe CLI Agent started

# Example:
> add a logging middleware to app.js  
> rename all *.ts files to *.tsx  
> refactor this function to be async
```

---

### 2. Vibe Code

Create, edit, explain, and deploy code using simple prompts.

```bash
# Example:
$ vibe create "a Hero component with a CTA and background"
$ vibe explain Hero.jsx
$ clode commit "adds Hero component"
$ vibe deploy vercel
$ vibe chat
$ vibe list all large files in this folder
```

---

### 3. Vibe Terminal

A smart terminal that autocompletes and corrects commands.

```bash
# Example:
$ vibe terminal
ðŸŒˆ Vibe Terminal Started

vibe-terminal> npm i expres
<terminal logs>

vibe-terminal> npm install express # autocorrected by Vibe
```
